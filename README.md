# ALFA — Automated Learning Framework for Animations# ALFA — Short Math Explainer Generator



> **TL;DR:** ALFA is an educational video generator that turns any problem or concept into a **30–180s** animated explanation with voice-over narration. Supports **Math, Chemistry, Physics, and Computer Science**!> **TL;DR:** ALFA is an app that turns any math problem you paste in into a **30–180s** video explanation with voice-over narration.



## What it does## What it does



* You enter a problem or concept in any supported subject* You paste a math problem.

* ALFA creates a short, clear, narrated video that shows the **steps** and the **why*** ALFA creates a short, clear, narrated video that shows the **steps** and the **why**.

* Generates professional animations with synchronized voice-overs

## Who it’s for

## Supported Subjects

Students, self‑learners, and busy folks who want fast, visual clarity instead of long lectures.

* 📐 **Mathematics** - Equations, geometry, calculus, algebra, and more

* 🧪 **Chemistry** - Reactions, molecular structures, stoichiometry, balancing equations## Why it’s useful

* ⚡ **Physics** - Kinematics, forces, energy, circuits, waves, and dynamics

* 💻 **Computer Science** - Algorithms, data structures, sorting, searching, complexity analysis* **One problem → one concise video**

* **Visual-first** explanations that highlight the key idea

## Who it's for* **Plain language** and friendly pacing



Students, self‑learners, educators, and anyone who wants fast, visual understanding instead of long lectures or dense textbooks.## How it works (simple)



## Why it's useful1. **Input**: Paste your problem + choose quality & voice-over options

2. **Generate**: AI creates script, animations, and voice-over

* **One problem → one concise video**3. **Process**: Videos are rendered and combined automatically

* **Visual-first** explanations that highlight the key idea4. **Output**: A complete video ready to watch or download

* **Subject-specific** visualizations (molecular models, force diagrams, code execution, graphs)

* **Plain language** and friendly pacing> Built with **Gradio** (UI), **GPT-4** (script generation), **Manim** (animations), **Google TTS** (voice-over), and **FFmpeg** (video processing).

* **Professional quality** with smooth animations and clear audio

## Quick Start

## How it works (simple)

```bash

1. **Select Subject**: Choose Math, Chemistry, Physics, or Computer Science# Install dependencies

2. **Input Problem**: Enter your problem or concept to explainuv sync

3. **Generate**: AI creates subject-specific script, animations, and voice-over

4. **Process**: Videos are rendered and combined automatically# Start the app

5. **Output**: A complete educational video ready to watch or shareuv run python main.py

```
