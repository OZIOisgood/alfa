# ALFA — Short Math Explainer Generator

> **TL;DR:** ALFA is an app that turns any math problem you paste in into a **30–180s** video explanation.

## What it does

* You paste a math problem.
* ALFA creates a short, clear, narrated video that shows the **steps** and the **why**.

## Who it’s for

Students, self‑learners, and busy folks who want fast, visual clarity instead of long lectures.

## Why it’s useful

* **One problem → one concise video**
* **Visual-first** explanations that highlight the key idea
* **Plain language** and friendly pacing

## How it works (simple)

1. Input: paste your problem
2. Generate: script + visuals + voice
3. Output: a clean 30–180s explainer clip

> First version ships as a **simple Gradio app**. (Under the hood: LLM for script, Manim for visuals, voiceover engine.)

## Status

* ✅ Concept locked: micro-length, single‑idea explainers
* 🚧 Prototype: basic flow in progress
* 🎬 Pilot: first sample problems queued (algebra & geometry)

## What’s next

* Publish a minimal demo page and 3 example clips
* Add a “Try your own problem” input
* Collect quick feedback and iterate on clarity/pacing
